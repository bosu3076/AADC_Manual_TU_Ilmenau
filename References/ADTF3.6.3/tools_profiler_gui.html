        <p>
            Since ADTF version <span class="badge badge-secondary">3.3.0</span> ADTF3 comes with built-in profiling 
            support based upon <a href="https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler">easy_profiler</a>. To make use of it 
            and analyue your instance, threads and blocks, the code must be instrumented.
        </p>
        
        <h3>How to instrument my code for profiling?</h3>
        
        <p>
            To add profiling blocks to your own code, just <code>#include &lt;easy/profiler.h&gt;</code> 
            and use the supplied macros from easy_profiler.
            For example just use the <code>EASY_FUNCTION()</code> macro  in each of your functions you want to profile.
        </p>
        <p>
            For a more in-depth documentation take a look at https://github.com/yse/easy_profiler.
        </p>

        <h3>Capture Profiling Data</h3>
        <p>
            The ADTF SDKs and Services are already instrumented so you can start profiling right away. 
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" >
            <pre><code>adtf_launcher --profiler</code></pre>
            </div>
            For more options use
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" >
            <pre><code>adtf_launcher --help</code></pre>
            </div>
            regarding profiling support.
        </p>
        <p>        
            You can now launch the <code>profiler_gui.exe</code> executable located in the <code>bin</code> folder of your ADTF delivery. 
            Click the connect button and check the available profiling blocks with the help of the according button in the toolbar. 
            There you can select which blocks you want to record, but most of the time you can just leave them all enabled. 
            Make sure the ADTF session is doing whatever you want to profile and then hit the Capture button in the toolbar. 
            Press stop when you have collected enough data.
            
            <div class="alert alert-warning" >
                We recommend to use the delivered <code>.bat</code> (Windows) / <code>.sh</code> (Linux) files 
                to start. The Profiling GUI needs to know where the Qt delivery is located, which will be set 
                by these scripts.
            </div>
        </p>
        
        <h3>Analyse Profiling Data</h3>
        
        <p>
            The following screenshot shows a profiling session of the example session Demo Standard Filters Session:
            <figure class="figure">
			<img src="screenshots/tools/profiler_gui/profiling_analysis.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
			<figcaption class="figure-caption">Profiler GUI</figcaption>
            </figure>
            The upper bar graph shows all threads and their executed blocks. 
            You can select a time range with pressed right mouse-button and get detailed information in the lower tree view. 
            Clicking and hovering the mouse over a block will give you a pop-up with detailed statistics. 
            The bar graph in the center will then show you the execution time over the whole capture period, 
            there you can spot any spikes easily.
        </p>
        <p>
            In our example we can observe that the timer_runner first executes the trigger function of 
            <span class="badge badge-light">Demo Time Triggered Filter 2</span> then the trigger function of <span class="badge badge-light">Demo Time Trigger 1</span> followed 
            by the execution of the trigger function of <span class="badge badge-light">Demo Data Trigger</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When taking a look at the thread runner we see that the trigger function of the <span class="badge badge-light">Demo Thread Triggered Filter</span> 
            is executed in a busy loop fashion. Right after the <span class="badge badge-light">Demo Data Trigger</span> has processed its output we see an increase 
            in the execution time on this thread as well, as this trigger function is waiting for some data to be available.
        </p>
