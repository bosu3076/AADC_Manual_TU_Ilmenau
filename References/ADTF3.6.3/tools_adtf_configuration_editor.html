			This guide covers what an ADTF Session is and where the Configuration Editor comes into play. After reading this guide, you will know:
			<ul>
				<li>The different files you need to know in ADTF3</li>
				<li>How to create ADTF Sessions with the Configuration Editor</li>
				<li>How to launch an ADTF Session</li>
                <li>How to work with the CE</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info" role="info">
			Since ADTF <span class="badge badge-secondary">3.6.0</span> you can also execute the Configuration Editor as a <b>Runtime User</b>, but 
            only in <code>Read-Only Mode</code> to view the sessions, graphs and properties without edit functionality (this is still part of the 
            <b>Developer License</b>). So these are the restrictions, other functions like launching tools or sessions or navigate from Home View 
            will work the same.
        </div>

		<h3>Files you need to know</h3>
		<p>
			Creating a new ADTF Project with the Configuration Editor results in a new folder named after the project, containing:
			<ul>
				<li>A project file <code>*.adtfproject</code> which defines</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Names and paths to all session files<span></li>
					<li>Names and paths to all graph files<span></li>
					<li>Names and paths to all system files<span></li>
				</ul>
				<li>A new folder named <i class="fa fa-folder-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="badge badge-light">adtfsessions</span></li>
				<ul>
					<li>New session files are created here. These files have the suffix <code>*.adtfsession</code> and define the path to the selected</li>
					<ul>
						<li>system file</li>
						<li>system properties file</li>
						<li>graph file</li>
						<li>graph properties file</li>
					</ul>
					<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
						The <b>session</b> is what the <code>adtf_launcher</code> can run. The <b>session</b> defines:
						<ul>
							<li>The system file to use. Maybe you have a system file for x86, ARM, etc.</li>
							<li>The streaming graph and therefore where the data comes from and flows to</li>
							<li>The filter graph doing the data processing, filtering, calculation, visualisation, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<li>A new folder named <i class="fa fa-folder-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="badge badge-light">adtfgraphs</span></li>
					<ul>
						<li>New graph files are created here. These files have the suffix <code>*.adtfgraph</code> and contain</li>
						<ul>
							<li>all created <span class="badge badge-light">Filter Graphs</span> as XML structure and the objects they consist of</li>
							<li>all created <span class="badge badge-light">Streaming Graphs</span> as XML structure and the objects they consist of</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The layout attributes of a graph are stored in a file called <code>*.adtfconfiglayout</code></li>
						<li>The properties of a graph changed by the user are stored in a file called <code>*.adtfproperties</code></li>
					</ul>	
					<li>A new folder named <i class="fa fa-folder-o" aria-hidden="true"></i><span class="badge badge-light">adtfsystems</span></li>
					<ul>
						<li>
							When new system descriptions are created the <code>*.adtfsystem</code> files representing them
							at file level, are created here. Such a file contains
						</li>
						<ul>
							<li>a list of environment variables</li>
							<li>the platform dependend binaries</li>
							<li>a list of plugin descriptions to load</li>
							<li>an ordered list of services to load</li>
						</ul>
						<li>The properties of a system configuration changed by the user are stored in a file called <code>*.adtfproperties</code></li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			</ul>

		<h3 id="start">Start the Configuration Editor</h3>
		<p>
			In order to start the Configuration Editor go to the <i class="fa fa-folder-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>
			<span class="badge badge-light">bin</span> directory of the ADTF installation folder
			and double click on the <code>adtf_configuration_editor.exe</code> file.

		<h4><a name="project_view">The Project View</a></h4>
		<p>
			The main files that make up a project are session files, graph files and system files. The project view
			enables you to create, delete and rename these files. The context menu of session files is of special interest,
			because you can <strong>run the session</strong> directly with the ADTF Launcher in various ways:
		</p>

		<h5>Run the selected session with the ADTF Control</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF Control</code><br>
				An ADTF launcher is started and an ADTF Control is connected to it. <strong>You can issue control commands.</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF Control (debug)</code><br>
				Same as above but debug libraries are loaded to enable debugging.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF Control (profiling)</code> <br>
				Run the selected session with the ADTF Control with profiling enabled.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Run the selected session with the ADTF GUI Control</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF GUI Control</code><br>
				An ADTF launcher is started and an ADTF GUI Control is connected to it. <strong>A graphical user interface
				is provided to issue control commands.</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF GUI Control (debug)</code><br>
				Same as above but debug libraries are loaded to enable debugging.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF GUI Control (profiling)</code><br>
				Run the selected session with the ADTF GUI Control with profiling enabled.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h5>Run the selected session with the ADTF Launcher</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF Launcher</code><br>
				The session is loaded and the run level is set to <code>running</code>.
				You can see the output of the streaming and filter graph in the console but you <strong>cannot issue control commands</strong>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF Launcher (debug)</code><br>
				Same as above but debug libraries are loaded to enable debugging.
			</li>
			<li>
				<code>Launch with ADTF Launcher (profiling)</code><br>
				Run the selected session with the ADTF Launcher with profiling enabled.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
            Since ADTF <span class="badge badge-secondary">3.6.0</span> we provide a new entry point for the Configuration Editor. 
            The Home View is not only a Landing Page, it offers some quick actions to create or open projects and jump to documentation at the top.
            The Left navigation bar provides some default actions linking to additional information which can be adapted in your cesettings file (see <a href="#options">Settings Editor (Options)</a>)
        </p>

		<h4>The Editors</h4>
		<p>
			In the center of the graphical user interface you find three kinds of editors:
		</p>
		<h5><a name="session_editor">Session Editor</a></h5>
		<p>
			A project maybe contains a lot of streaming graph, filter graph and system definitions, but as soon as we want to run
			a certain combination of it with the help of the ADTF launcher things must be clearly defined. The session defines what system
			should be loaded, which streaming graph should act as data source and data sink and what filter graph should manipulate
			the data.
		</p>
		<figure class="figure">
			<img src="screenshots/tools/adtf_configuration_editor/ce_session_editor.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
			<figcaption class="figure-caption">The Session Editor</figcaption>
		</figure>
			
		<h5><a name="streaming_graph_editor">Streaming Graph Editor</a></h5>
		<p>
			Data must either be generated somehow or a kind of data source must be plugged in to get data into the ADTF system.
			On the other side data is consumed by someone or must leave the ADTF system through some kind of data sink.
			This is what the streaming graph is good for. Developers use the SDK to write their own <a href="sdk_streaming_source.html">
			sources</a> and <a href="sdk_streaming_sink.html">sinks</a>. To let data flow between two elements
			place a <code>Sample Stream</code> between them and connect the pins by drawing a line. Follow this
			<a href="../adtf_html/page_streaming_graph.html">link</a> for
			more information about streaming graphs.
		</p>
		<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
			Data transfer from the Streaming Graph to the Filter Graph begins with a <code>Sample Stream</code> placed on the
			<code>Filter Graph Dock</code> and continous on the Filter Graph level with a <code>Streaming Inport</code>. The
			connection is created autmatically but only if the name of <code>Sample Stream</code> and <code>Streaming Inport</code>
			are exactly the same.
		</div>
		<figure class="figure">
			<img src="screenshots/tools/adtf_configuration_editor/ce_streaming_graph_editor.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
			<figcaption class="figure-caption">The Streaming Graph Editor</figcaption>
		</figure>
        <p>
            Use right-click and context menu in any free space of the graph area for adding notes 
            and some zoom options.
        </p>

		<h5><a name="filter_graph_editor">Filter Graph Editor</a></h5>
		<p>
			The filter graph is where the data manipulation and data analysis takes place. Data comes from the streaming graph through
			<code>Streaming Inports</code> and leaves the filter graph through <code>Streaming Outports</code>. Both types can be added
			through the context menu of the Graph Editor. It is important to mention that the name of the <code>Streaming Port</code>
			and the name of the <code>Sample Stream</code> in the connected Streaming Graph are the same. Follow this
			<a href="../adtf_html/page_filter_graph.html">link</a> for more information
			about filter graphs.
		</p>
		<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
			Data transfer from the Filter Graph to the Streaming Graph goes through a <code>Streaming Outport</code> on the Filter Graph
			level and continous with a <code>Sample Stream</code> on Streaming Graph level, placed on the <code>Filter Graph Dock</code>.
			The connection is created autmatically but only if the name of the <code>Streaming Outport</code> and the <code>Sample Stream</code>
			are exactly the same.
		</div>
		<p>
			Processing can be triggered with the help of different types of <code>Runners</code>. By default triggers are sent between
			the data samples and stimulate the following filter to do further processing, however if this behavior is not desired,
			connections can be configured to be asynchronous. In this case <code>Time Runner</code> can be used to take control over
			the exact timing (this can be useful for expensive visual updates) or <code>Thread Runner</code> to do heavy processing on
			a different thread. To let data flow between two elements place a <code>Sample Stream</code> between them and connect the
			pins by drawing a line.

			<figcaption class="figure-caption">The Filter Graph Editor</figcaption>

        <p>
            Use right-click and context menu in any free space of the graph area for adding an existing 
            Filter Graph as subgraph (handled like a common filter), defining interfaces for in and 
            out relations and, of course, some zoom functionality.
        </p>
		
		<h5><a name="property_editor">Property Editor</a></h5>
		<p>
			If elements in the component view or in one of the editors provide some configuration options they are displayed inside the
			Property Editor.
			<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
                If a property accepts strings or numbers make sure to finish editing by hitting enter otherwise the input 
                might get lost.
			</div>

			<img width="50%" src="screenshots/tools/adtf_configuration_editor/ce_properties.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
			<figcaption class="figure-caption">The Property Editor</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<h5><a name="system_editor">System Editor</a></h5>
		<p>
			Double clicking a system file in the Project View opens it inside the System Editor. If your session incorporates
			filters, sources or sinks that have dependencies to libraries outside of ADTF this is the right place to define them.
			Environments variables are useful to abstract away from platform specific paths which makes it easier to transfer project
			files between different PCs or operting systems. You can define additional platform dependencies (e.g. OpenCV or Qt DLL libraries),
			ADTF services and ADTF Plugins.<br>
			If a component defines its ADTF dependencies properly required services are added automatically as soon as a component is
			dropped from the components view into an editor. If you want to know more about how components can define their ADTF dependencies
			follow this <a href="../adtf_html/page_ucom_setup_dependencies.html">link</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The order in wich services are loaded can be influenced in two ways:
			<ul>
				<li>Services are loaded in a defined runlevel and can be changed in the System Editor</li>
				<li>
					Services are loaded in the order they are defined in the System Editor. This order can be
					change with the up and down buttons.
				</li>
			</ul>
			If a service offers configuration options they will be shown by selecting the service and if you want to rename a 
			service the Rename entry is your friend. Also if you want to define services in a different runlevel.

            Since the Redesign in <span class="badge badge-secondary">3.6.0</span> all actions in each navigation section are available 
            via context menu. This means, if you want to add a new service instance, choose <b>Service</b> in the left navigation, and somewhere

			In order to avoid invalid system file paths when distributing an ADTF project, define an ADTF environment variable to abstract
			away the system file path. All you have to do when moving to a different PC is adjust the environment variable accordingly.
			Since ATDF <span class="badge badge-secondary">3.3.1</span> environment variables defined by the operating system e.g.
			<code class="language-cmake">set TOOLBOXES=C:\toolboxes</code> can be used when defining ADTF environment variables.

			<span class="badge badge-secondary">3.6.0</span>).
			You can add new entries, edit existing entries or delete obsolete entries. Entries must have a unique name and
			they must point to a valid HTTP URL. If a path to an icon is given, the icon will be shown in fornt of the name.

			<strong>Modules</strong> section - since <span class="badge badge-secondary">3.4.0</span>
			the functionality of the Configuration Editor can be extended by writing a module. The bootstrap meachnism of the
			Configuration Editor looks inside the folders defined in this list and searches for files with
			postfix <code>.*adtfceplugin</code>. When found the Configuration Editor loads these files as Qt plugins.
			You can find an example module in "examples/bin/ce_external_property_module_example.adtfceplugin" and have a look
			at <a href="tutorial_ce_module.html">ADTF CE Module</a> and here <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5.9/qtqml-modules-cppplugins.html">
